	<h2>Recipes</h2>
	
	<h3>Runtack</h3>
	<p>
	On long mountain runs I like carrying just plain water: beyond hydration you can soak a bandanna
	against the heat, or clean out a wound, and it's easier to refill at a stream than trying to
	mess around with powder mix. So I go to food bars for calories and electrolytes, but as the miles
	stack up commercial products would get expensive. I started making my own, and from time to time
	people ask me for the recipe, here it is:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>½ c. quick oats</li>
		<li>¼ t. salt</li>
		<li>1/16 t. "salt substitute" (KCl)</li>
		<li>1 T sugar</li>
		<li>½ c. water</li>
	</ul>
	<ol>
		<li>Mix everything together and microwave on high one minute.</li>
		<li>Mix again to really get it gelatinous and uniform.</li>
		<li>Spread thinly on a baking sheet, bake at 400°F about 8 minutes.</li>
		<li>Take the baking sheet out of the oven, cut into quarters, flip, and return to oven.</li>
		<li>Continue baking maybe 6 minutes or so, then turn off the heat and prop the oven door to continue drying.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	I usually let it sit out under a towel overnight to dry more before bringing it on a run the next
	morning. The goal is a texture that's rubbery on the inside and crispy on the outside, which I
	find holds up well in the pack but is easy to eat. Leftovers I freeze, then take out to thaw the
	night before. It'll get moldy if you just
	leave it out more than a couple days.
	</p>
	<p>
	That recipe makes 4 bars, sized for 1 bar per hour of exercise. It can easily be scaled up for
	more but the measurements get futzy if you try scaling down.
	The oatmeal has pretty much exactly the right carb:protein ratio for long distances according
	to some numbers I got from <i>The Lore of Running</i> by Dr. Noakes. It's also pretty bland, 
	which I find to be welcome as the hours stack up.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Unholy Matrimony</h3>
	<p>
	Brew a cup or pot of good quality tea, then reserve some in a sealed container and refrigerate.
	When it's chilled, mix your favorite good whisky and the tea in a 1:1 ratio.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The name comes because, to purists of either the tea or the whisky, mixing them like this
	is a sacrilege. But I find their flavors don't step on each other at all, rather they complement
	perfectly. My go-to mix is dragonwell (longjing) tea and Highland Park whisky. I can imagine
	(but haven't yet tried) that lapsang souchong and something like Laphroaig would be a fine mix
	too.
